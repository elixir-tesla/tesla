# Testing

There are two primary ways to mock requests in Tesla:

- Using `Mox`
- Using `Tesla.Mock` (deprecated)

You can also create a custom mock adapter if needed. For more information about
adapters, refer to the [Adapter Guide](./3.adapter.md) to create your own.

## Should I Use `Mox` or `Tesla.Mock`?

We recommend using `Mox` for mocking requests in tests because it
is well-established in the Elixir community and provides robust features for
concurrent testing. While `Tesla.Mock` offers useful capabilities, it may be
removed in future releases. Consider using `Mox` to ensure long-term
compatibility.
For additional context, see [GitHub Issue #241](https://github.com/elixir-tesla/tesla/issues/241).
